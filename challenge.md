**Challenge: Node.js Image Compressor with Parallel Processing**

**Objective:** Develop a Node.js application that efficiently compresses multiple images concurrently using threads.

**Key requirements:**

1. **Event-driven image reading:** Use the `fs` module to asynchronously read images from a directory or a list of files.
2. **Buffering image data:** Store image data in Buffer objects for efficient manipulation.
3. **Multithreaded compression:** Spawn worker threads using `worker_threads` to handle image compression tasks in parallel.
4. **Communication between threads:** Pass image data and compression parameters to worker threads, and receive compressed images back.
5. **Optimized compression algorithm:** Choose a suitable image compression algorithm (e.g., JPEG, PNG) and implement it within the worker threads, optimizing for performance.
6. **File saving and error handling:** Save the compressed images to disk, handling potential errors gracefully.

**Bonus points:**

- Implement progress reporting to track compression progress.
- Allow configuration of compression settings (e.g., quality level).
- Support different image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF).
- Explore alternative compression algorithms or libraries for optimal performance.

**Additional tips:**

- Utilize Node.js's asynchronous nature to maximize concurrency and avoid blocking operations.
- Employ efficient Buffer operations for image data handling.
- Consider using image processing libraries to simplify compression tasks.
- Test your application with various image sizes and compression settings to assess performance.


**Here are some recommended libraries for the Node.js image compressor challenge:**

**Image processing libraries:**

- **sharp:** A high-performance Node.js image processing library that can handle various image manipulation tasks, including compression.
- **jimp:** Another popular option for image processing, offering a wide range of features.
- **imagemin:** A library specifically designed for optimizing and compressing images, with support for multiple image formats and compression algorithms.

We use **sharp** in this case.
